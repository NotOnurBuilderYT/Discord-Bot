Hello,

I did this discord bot using javascript when I was 11-12 years old. It was a fun project and was the main reason I began coding. Around 50% of the code is handwritten by me while the others are from kind people who would help me with the errors I would get, or YouTube Tutorials on how the make the basics of a discord bot.

As of 11/2/2021 (Currently I'm 13 years old) I have quit this project 11 months ago due to lack of time and motivation. The main part of this project was to save people time and entertain them which I have achieved at a small scale.

The main reason I'm typing this is because that I want to keep this as a memory and would remind me of good times and the first time I started to code.

To the future myself I hope you are having a good day :)
